# MathematicaCLI
Command Line Interface for Mathematica, a modern equation solver.

# Motivation
MathematicaCLI is the primitive form of Mathematica, a future software for learning and discovering math.
Mathematics is a world of beauty and its abstractness may be difficult for most people. Making math easy
is a problem for the century and this project is a way to solve it.

# Platforms
MathematicaCLI is built for Windows, macOS and Linux. However, Windows and macOS are the only platforms I can test regularly,
Linux is only tested through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ZeXo-Softwares/MathematicaCLI/actions).

# Getting started
MathematicaCLI uses [premake5](https://premake.github.io) to build the source, and for now, a binary source of such program is distributed with the source code.
To generate project files for your platform launch `generate.py`, to clean unnecessary files use `clean.py` and last, you can use the wrapper `run.py`
to access quickly the binaries.

# Authors
Even if this project is hosted on the ZeXo Softwares page, its development is entirely carried on by @Ciridev.

# Licensing
This project is licensed under the MIT license.
