# MathematicaCLI
A Command Line Interface for Mathematica, an equation solver.

# Motivation
MathematicaCLI is the primitive form of Mathematica, a future software for learning and discovering math.
Mathematics is a world of beauty and its abstractness may be difficult for most people. Making math easy
is a problem for the century and this project is a way to solve it.

# Platforms
MathematicaCLI is currently built for Windows and macOS, hence a Linux distribution is yet to come.
We are planning to extend this software on this platform too as soon as possible.

# Getting started
MathematicaCLI uses [premake5](https://premake.github.io) to build the source, and for now, a binary source of such program is distributed with the source code.
To generate project files for your platform launch `generate.py`, to clean unnecessary files use `clean.py` and last, you can use the wrapper `run.py`
to access quickly the binaries.

# Authors
Although the project is hosted on the ZeXo Softwares page, its development is entirely carried by @Ciridev.

# Licensing
This project is licensed under the MIT license.
